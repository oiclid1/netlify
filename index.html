                    that make using the product hard.

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="heading2">Netlify/Staticgen <br></h2>
                    <p  class="normal">I was really impressed with how easy it was to host on Netlify. I have used a lot of hosting services before, but the only one that compare in terms of how easy it is to deploy a site would be GitHUb Pages. The only problem I had was with a couple of the Static Site Generators.  The first two ones I chose gave me a little trouble, but once I was able to find one that did not require too much effort to setup, the whole thing was a breeze!</p>

                    <p  class="normal">I did not want to spend a lot of time installing modules and dependencies, so I decided to use work with a site generator based on JavaScript. I eventually had to try three different site generators before I found one that worked easily for me.  I first tried Gatsby, but I kept getting all sort of error messages, most of which seemed related to out-of-date modules. After I got tired of updating Node, NPM, and eventually individual modules, I just threw in the towel. I decided to try Enduro. I don’t know if it was because my internet speed was slow, or what, but it took way too long to setup. At the end all I got a couple was an Unhandled Promise Rejection message. I cancelled it after waiting for it to end after 30 minutes. I decided to find the simplest JavaScript site generator on staticgen. I needed no bells and whistles, just straight up install and run. And so, I chose Silex. It was so easy to run (I cloned a repo and opened the index.html file) that I felt stupid spending all that time trying to debug other site generators. For simple projects henceforth, I would use Silex. </p>

                    <p  class="normal">I currently cannot think of any suggestion on how to improve this test and/or the job posting. </p>

                  <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="heading2">Documentation<br></h2>
                  My favorite  technical product documentation is the Amazon Web Services (AWS)<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/"> documentation</a>. I love it because, unlike a lot of other product documentations, following the instructions <b>ALWAYS</b> work. At least I cannot remember an instance in which they did not  A lot of the time, documentation seems to be written for an OS, product version, or even year other than the one you are using. Or live in. It can be frustrating that one had to spend a lot of time in forums looking for solutions after spending a lot of time going through the documentation. I know there are a lot of products I have not used in AWS, but for all of those I have, AWS’ docs has always had my back in ways that Google Cloud, Heroku, GitHub Pages, GoDaddy, MongoDB, Node, Django, MySQL, etc never have. I think it is the one and only service or software that I have learned how to use by reading only the documentation.

                       <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="heading2">SSL/HTTPS<br></h2>
                       <p  class="normal">SSL/HTTPS provides a secure connection between the web host and the client. This is important because it:
<ol>
<li>Encrypts all information being transferred across the connection. This makes it hard for anybody to easily eavesdrop on the connection. The user is assured that his/her sensitive information such as passwords, card numbers, etc, are secure and not easily stolen.</li>
<li>It provides authentication, assuring the user that information is being sent to (and received from) the right servers, and not to imposters.</li>
<li>It enable users to have greater trust that the websites they are transacting with is not an imposter, and that they are secure. </li>

                       <h2 style="text-align: center;" class="heading2">DNS<br></h2>
                       <p  class="normal">One common DNS configuration challenge encountered by less-technical end users is figuring out how to fix name resolution errors without making it to be static, as opposed to dynamic. Another major challenge is figuring out a way to get the client to stop querying the list of servers only if it gets a positive answer. That is, ensuring that both a timeout and a negative answer would make the client to end query the next server on the list.</p>

                       <p  class="normal">Make sure your GitHub account is connected to your SiteGen account. Once that is done, push add and commit any changes you have made to your code, and then push the code to GitHub. Once that is done, simply run "netlify deploy". This would deploy your code to StaticGen. Repeat the process anytime you change your code to keep your website up-to-date.</p>
                       <p  class="normal">To view your app's admin dashboard, log into your Netlify account and select the app you want to view. The view you would be presented with would give you various options, giving you full control of your app.</p>
